A comprehensive machine learning framework for automated pulsar signal detection and classification using multiple state-of-the-art algorithms with rigorous Bayesian evaluation metrics.

## 🔬 Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification of pulsar signals, distinguishing between genuine pulsar emissions and radio frequency interference (RFI). The system employs multiple classification algorithms with sophisticated preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques commonly used in astrophysical signal processing.

- **📊 Advanced Preprocessing**: PCA dimensionality reduction with automated component selection
- **🔍 Rigorous Evaluation**: Bayesian metrics including minimum Detection Cost Function (minDCF) and actual DCF
- **⚖️ Score Calibration**: Platt scaling for probability calibration and improved reliability
- **📈 Comprehensive Visualization**: ROC curves, DET plots, Bayes error plots, and feature analysis
- **🔄 Robust Validation**: K-fold cross-validation and single-split validation strategies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pulsar-classification.git
cd pulsar-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```python
from library import utils, GaussianClassifier, LogisticRegression, SVM, GMM

# Load and preprocess data
(DTR, LTR), (DTE, LTE) = utils.load_dataset_shuffle('Train.txt', 'Test.txt', 8)

# Apply PCA preprocessing
PCA_components = utils.PCA(DTR, 7)
DTR_pca = PCA_components[0]

# Train classifier
model = GaussianClassifier.GaussianClassifier()
trained_model = model.trainClassifier(DTR_pca, LTR, [0.5, 0.5], 'MVG', True)

# Evaluate with Bayesian metrics
scores = trained_model.computeLLR(DTR_pca)
min_dcf = utils.minDCF(scores, LTR, 0.5, 1, 1)
