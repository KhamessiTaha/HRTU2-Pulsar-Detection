# HTRU2-Pulsar-Detection
Project relative to the analysis of the HTRU2 dataset through the use of Machine Learning algorithms. Exam of Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition held at Politecnico di Torino during A.Y. 2021/2022

## How to understand the repo
* [report.pdf](report.pdf) is the paper of the project that contains motivations to choices made during the analysis and explainations of remarkable results.
* [main.py](main.py) is the file from which you can obtain every plot and value shown in the paper.
* [library](library) is a folder containing a collection of Machine Learning algorithms.

## Known issues in [main.py](main.py) (as highlighted by the professor)
* application of PCA
* score calibration of the training set

## Important!
Since this is a project relative to the study of ML models, no ML libraries or ML toolboxes have been used.
